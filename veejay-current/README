QUICK OVERVIEW
==============

Read the HOWTO if you a new user , see doc/veejay-HOWTO.html 

To see a list of key events, type 'man veejay' in your shell or try 
'cat veejay/vj-event.c |grep SDLK' for a more up to date version.        

For users with Intel Pentium 4 processors with Hyper Threading, benefit
if they enable SMP in their kernel 2.6.x  

Since version 0.6.3, veejay doesnt have a console interface anymore!!!
Use 'sayVIMS -i' to enter interactive mode and give '?' or 'h' 
to see a list of commands, or simply type VIMS style messages.


PLUGINS
=======

 As of version 0.6.3 , veejay supports a plugin architecture for pull/push plugins.


INSTALLING
===========

    In general, ./configure && make && make install if you meet 
    all requirements.
    
    

Running Veejay
==============

Start the core with
	
'veejay <options> <filename 1 ,... , filename N>'

examples:

1. have a small SDL window (for the keybindings) and DirectFB:

   'veejay -O2 -S171x144 /video/video.avi'


2. run veejay without a video file

   (not anymore but perhaps in the future again ?)
