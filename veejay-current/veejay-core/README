Veejay - a 'visual' instrument and realtime video sampler

Veejay is a visual instrument and real-time video sampler.
It allows you to "play" the video like you would play a piano.
While playing, you can record the resulting video directly to disk (video sampling).


====== quick install:

   order of packages:
    **required** ; veejay-core, veejay-server
    **optional** ; veejay-client, veejay-utils, plugin-packs

   for each package:
     ./autogen.sh
     ./configure
     make && sudo make install
     sudo ldconfig

   to build for a specific target:
     ./configure --with-arch-target=generic|core2|k6|native|i686


   if you want to debug veejay-server (or if you want to submit a meaningful backtrace), build with:

     ./configure --enable-debug


   to build plugins:

   cd veejay-sever/livido-plugins
   ./RUNME.sh /tmp/plugins

   install the plugins in your home-dir:

   mkdir ~/.veejay    # or start veejay 
   echo "/tmp/plugins" >> ~/.veejay/plugins.cfg


   install GMIC,

   cd plugin-packs/lvdgmic
   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure && make

(1)	Free Software
	A matter of liberty, not price. You should think of  “free” as in free speech.
	Free software is the matter of the users freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. 

(2)	A servent architecture is a peer-to-peer network mode with both functionalities of a
	server and a client. The setup is designed so that each veejay-node can send and receive video,
	allowing for the creation and maintenance of ad-hoc veejay-networks.
	Reloaded , veejay's graphical interface, is a thin client and can be run from another computer
	to track one or more veejay servers.

(3)	Soft realtime: A system is realtime if the correctness of the application not only depends on
	the logical correctness but also upon the time at which it was performed.
	Veejay tolerates such lateness and responds by dropping video frames. 
	You can instruct veejay to ignore the time aspect of the video and render all frames, effectivly
	turning the server into a frame producer.

(4)	VIMS: Veejay Internal Message System.  Control data is distributed via this message system,
	each message consists of an 'event selector' with a list of arguments.  VIMS is the lowest
	level control interface available. The keyboard interface and OSC server are built on top of it.
	Also all veejay clients communicate usings VIMS.

(5)	Loop based editing:  Loops are (short) sections of video (up to any length) that are repeated
	continuously. While playing, you can change the properties of the video sample, add filters to it
	and record it on the fly to a new sample (which can be used instantly).

(6)	Frame accurate: In veejay, every frame is a key-frame (a whole image).
	As a consequence, veejay has no support for video codecs that make use of difference frames.

(7)	In trickplay mode, veejay will always resample the audio analogous to varying the speed
	of an analogue tape recorder . Halve the speed results in the pitch going down an octave.
	Slow motion video is produced by linearly interpolating in-between frames and
	faster motion is accomplished by skipping video frames or, if playing without audio,
	by changing the framerate dynamically.

(8)	JACK: A low latency audio server that can connect a number of different applications to an audio device,
	allowing them to share audio between themselves. http://jackaudio.org/

(9)	Perspective Viewing: You can define a quadrilateral to which the rendered image will be mapped.
	This is usefull for setups where the image borders fall outside the projection screen area, or where
	the projector/camera has a (wide) angle to the projection.
	Last but not least, it can be used for on-body projection performances.
